# Release notes

### 6.0.2 (2018-12-04)

**Enhancements**

* Starting from 6.0.x carina-core became a listener with unified CarinaListener class:
    * most of the AbstractTest core methods moved to CarinaListener
    * incorporated HealthCheckListener as part of CarinaListener
    * splited initialization logic into static block and ISuiteListener->onStart(suite) method
    * incorporated DriverPool cleanup on shutdown hook
    * **Note:** some changes are incompatible in comparison with 5.x.x versions and need manual updates according to the **Migration Steps** 
* Migrated to the latest 6.14.3 TestNG version with fully supported retry execution feature
* Updated build numbering structure according all qaprosoft projects:
    * **6**.0.0 - core generation
    * 6.**0**.0 - service pack release
    * 6.0.**0** - cross release build number which starts from 0 in 6th generation (in 5.x.x.x release latest build number is 5.3.3.**129**)
* Finalized integration rules for Zafira integration:
    * Add ZafiraListener in global pom.xml to inject it for all CI runs
    * Add ZafiraListener into each TestNG suite to be able to run locally with Zafira integration
    * Note: carina archetype updated accordingly
* Refactored DriverPool class and deliver it as functional IDriverPool interface
    * It allowed to remove driver_mode property and calculate driver lifecycle automatically based on rules below:
         * All drivers started during @BeforeSuite phase are saved across all suite run
         * All drivers started during @BeforeClass phase are saved across current test class run
         * All drivers started during @BeforeMethod phase or inside method are saved only for current method and closed automatically
         * To be able to keep "method mode" drivers just use dependsOnMethods property in @Test annotation.
```
Example:
    @Test()
    public void test1() {
        getDriver(); //start new driver
        ...
    }
    @Test(dependsOnMethods="test1")
    public void test2() {
        getDriver(); //get existing driver started in test1 as test2 depends on test1
        ...
    }
    @Test()
    public void test3() {
        getDriver(); //start new driver as no dependencies detected
        ...
    }
```
* Moved unit tests into the valid modules to be able to track coverage results in Sonar: https://ci.qaprosoft.com/sonarqube/dashboard/index?did=2
* Move some noisy log messages onto the DEBUG level
* added possibility to redefine log level for explicit sub-modules/classes
```
core_log_level=DEBUG
core_log_packages=IDriverPool,ZafiraConfigurator
```
* added support for Opera browser. For now both variants are ok:
    * browser=opera
    * browser=operablink 
* Removed all TestRail updaters from Carina and all required dto classes. Integration with 3rd party testcase management tools will be allowed through the https://github.com/qaprosoft/zafira only!
* Removed SMTP integration settings from Carina. All notification methods will be concentrated in Zafira Reporting Tool. Carina could only run and generate local report in ./reports/qa folder.
* Removed completely JUnit libraries from classpath to avoid invalid asserts import inside the test classes on projects level
* Removed cucumber integration as not used feature
* Removed all deprecated methods in DriverHelper
* Removed deprecated constructors in ExtendedWebElement class

**Fixes**

* Improved driver restart logic fixing [#364](https://github.com/qaprosoft/carina/issues/364) and [#552](https://github.com/qaprosoft/carina/issues/552).
* removed soapui.log4j.config property 
* reused new getConstructorOrMethod() function for getting methods instances
